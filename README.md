### Pre-requisites:

- Once you have an Ubuntu system follow the below steps assuming you already have git CLI installed

```sh
sudo -i // switch to root user
apt update -y
```

- Clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rohit1101/SRE-Bootcamp-Web-Server.git
```

- Install the dependencies required for the project:

```sh
# installs nvm (Node Version Manager)
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash

# download and install Node.js
nvm install 20

# verifies the right Node.js version is in the environment
node -v # should print `v20.14.0`

# verifies the right NPM version is in the environment
npm -v # should print `10.7.0`
```

- Install postgresql:

```sh
apt install postgresql // this install psql client for interacting with the database with quries
```

- Switch to postgres user and use psql client
  <img width="881" alt="image" src="https://github.com/rohit1101/SRE-Bootcamp-Web-Server/assets/37110560/d5e988b8-ad55-497c-8129-844b5f8eff33">

- Run the following command to set `postgres` user with a valid password and exit psql client using `\q` and type `exit` to logout from `postgres` user shell:

```psql
ALTER USER postgres PASSWORD 'postgres';
```

---

### üèÖCreate a simple REST API Webserver

After successful pre-requisites setup following the below steps:

- Now let us clone this repo(fork and clone) and move into the src of the web server code:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rohit1101/SRE-Bootcamp-Web-Server.git
cd SRE-Bootcamp-Web-Server
```

- Execute `make install` to install all the dependancies for the express js web server
- Run `make db_config` command creates a `knexfile.js` configuration file.
- Create a new directory named **migrations**

```sh
mkdir migrations
```

- Make sure you pass the correct values for the environment variables in a new file named `.env` by referring the `.env.example`. My `.env` file looks as shown below.\*Since I am testing the API locally I am using the default postgres DB for creating tables(on a production environment this is not recommended).

```env
NODE_ENV=development
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=postgres
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=postgres
```

- Modify the `knexfile.js` configuration file based on your requirements

```js
require("dotenv").config({ path: ".env" });
module.exports = {
  development: {
    client: "pg",
    connection: {
      user: process.env.DB_USER,
      host: process.env.DB_HOST,
      database: process.env.DB_DATABASE,
      password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD,
    },
    pool: {
      min: 2,
      max: 10,
    },
    migrations: {
      directory: "./migrations",
    },
  },
};
```

- Create a new migration, the following command will create a new migrations file in this path -> `migrations/` and update the migrations file by refering the migrations file in this repo.

```sh
make create_migrations
```

- This command applies the migration and creates the students table in your PostgreSQL database.

```sh
make migrate
```

- Now switch to `postgres` user and enter `psql` to check our `students` table:

### üèÖContainerise REST API

Follow the instructions to install docker on your Ubuntu Machine -> [Install docker on ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository)

- Create a Dockerfile for running the web server using `node-*-apline` image for reducing the image size

```Dockerfile
ARG NODE_VERSION=20.14.0

FROM node:${NODE_VERSION}-alpine AS build

# Set working directory as /app
WORKDIR /app

# copy deps
COPY ./package*.json ./

# install the dependencies
RUN npm install

# copy all source code
COPY . .

FROM build as run

WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app ./

# set envs required for the web-server to run
ARG NODE_ENV=development
ARG DB_USER=postgres
ARG DB_PASSWORD=postgres
ARG DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
ARG DB_PORT=5432
ARG DB_DATABASE=postgres

# expose port 3000 for the web server to be accessed
EXPOSE 3000

# execute this following command once the container boots
ENTRYPOINT ["npm","start"]
```

- Command for building a Docker Image and pushing it to Docker Hub (This step requires you to have a Docker Hub account):

```sh
# Create an image
docker build -t <docker-hub-repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag-name>v1.0
```

- Login using Docker Hub credentials:
  <img width="1435" alt="image" src="https://github.com/rohit1101/SRE-Bootcamp-Web-Server/assets/37110560/833c23f9-8e38-40b4-bbf8-ef6991800ffd">
- Command for pushing the image to your Docker Hub account:

```sh
docker push <docker-hub-repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag-name>v1.0
```

- To execute `make containerise` to pull the image from docker registry and create a `web-server` container make sure your provide your Docker Hub repo name and image with the desired tag.
- **NOTE: In the above Dockerfile I have directly passed a environment variables but in production environment it is better to use Docker secrets.**

### üèÖSetup one-click local development setup

Now let's make the local developement setup quicker by using `docker-compose` and trigger server and DB containers using a single `make` command

- First let us update the `.env` file with appropriate values since when we create containers using `docker-compose`

  ```sh
  NODE_ENV=development
  DB_USER=postgres
  DB_PASSWORD=postgres
  DB_HOST=db
  DB_PORT=5432
  DB_DATABASE=postgres
  ```

- Please refer the `compose.yaml` for creating DB container first and checking the health of postgresql DB which then triggers migrations and starts the web-server.

  - Server depends on DB service:
    ![alt text](image.png)

  - Health Check on DB:
    ![Health Check on DB](image-1.png)

- The following is the updated Dockerfile for applying migrations and starting the web server

  ```Dockerfile
  ENTRYPOINT ["sh", "-c", "npx knex migrate:latest && npm start"]
  ```

- Run `make start_app` for starting the app (web-server + db)
- Make a the following `curl` request and open `http://localhost:3000/v1/students` to view all students as response

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/v1/students \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Alice", "age": 23, "department": "Arts"}'
```

### üèÖSetup a CI pipeline

- For setting up self-hosted Github Actions Runner we need to navigate to the **Settings** tab from the repository.
  <img width="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/rohit1101/SRE-Bootcamp-Web-Server/assets/37110560/02a3bbe0-19ba-477f-bdc7-05bb66f06bc4">
- Then click on Actions dropdown and click on Runners.
  <img width="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/rohit1101/SRE-Bootcamp-Web-Server/assets/37110560/f9c9abff-6f79-49c0-8063-f16413e28de6">
- Click on **New self-hosted runner** button
  <img width="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/rohit1101/SRE-Bootcamp-Web-Server/assets/37110560/46757f92-023c-40f1-8076-70b2aa0949c6">
- Follow the instructions on this page and setup a self-hosted runner and make sure to set `runs-on: self-hosted`
  <img width="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/rohit1101/SRE-Bootcamp-Web-Server/assets/37110560/7ef31022-8fe0-460e-a3e5-cc5e3b83594a">
- Finally let us start our self-hosted runner to run workflows on our system:
  ```sh
    cd actions-runner/
    ./run.sh
  ```
- To setup github actions follow the below command from the root of the project folder and write your github action config on a `.yaml` file
  ```sh
    mkdir -p .github/workflows/
    cd .github/workflows/
    touch <github-action-filename>.yaml
  ```
